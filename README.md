## About

Infocus is a project management platform developed for Mercedes Benz to streamline the organization of building-related data. Designed to optimize the efficiency and transparency of construction processes, Infocus brings together all relevant project information into a unified digital environment. It draws inspiration from Lean Construction Management practices, similar to tools like Lindner's Lean Construction platform, allowing for a structured, collaborative approach to managing tasks and workflows. With Infocus, stakeholders can visualize project progress in real time, enhance coordination, and ultimately improve decision-making throughout the entire lifecycle of a construction project.
